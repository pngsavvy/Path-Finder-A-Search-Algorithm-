# Path-Finder-A-Search-Algorithm
This program finds the shortest path between point A and point B. before finding the path you can place walls. Click right arrow to step through solution slowly. Press space bar to solve completely.

Edit the board scale (how big each node is), width and height at the top of the path_finder_gui.py file

This was a fun project as it is interactive and very visual. It actually functions similarly to how Google map functions.
